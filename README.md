# Note App

This is a simple note-taking web application built using JavaScript. The app uses local storage as the storage mechanism for the notes.

## Usage

To use the app, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can add a new note by clicking the "Add Note" button. You can edit an existing note by double-clicking on it. You can also delete a note by double-clicking on it and confirming the delete action.

## Code

The code for the app can be found in the `index.html` file and the `script.js` file. The `script.js` file contains the JavaScript code that powers the app.

## Local Storage

The app uses local storage as the storage mechanism for the notes. This means that the notes will be saved in your browser's local storage and will persist even if you close the app or restart your computer.
